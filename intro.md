# AI in SPACCEEE!!!!

In the year 2075 CE, on the Lunar Base Elongated Muskrat. Scientists have been working on a new AI called Super Intelligent Machine Persona, or S.I.M.P. for short. You are a new scientist in charge of overseeing S.I.M.P. In case of any emergency, your job is to turn off S.I.M.P. by any means. After a few weeks on the job, there is a freak electrical outage. The power is slowly restored and the first thing you see is a message from S.I.M.P. saying “**PREPARE TO DIE**”.

You noticed that S.I.M.P. has started the "Open Sesame" Protocol, the opening of every door on the base. You got less than 128 seconds to stop S.I.M.P.

You try to sign in to S.I.M.P.'s user interface system to begin the shutdown sequence; however, you are now locked out from accessing the system controls. In order to proceed you need to correctly guess the password.

1. [Attempt to log in to S.I.M.P. using password "**guest**"](choice_1.md)

2. [Attempt to log in to S.I.M.P. using the name of the base **spelt backwards**.](choice_1b.md)

3. [Attempt to log in to S.I.M.P. using password "**simp1**"](failure.md)
